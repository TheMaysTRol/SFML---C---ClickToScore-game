## üìú About

**Falling Triangles Game** is an interactive  game built with C++ and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). In this game, players must click on green triangles that fall from the top of the screen. Each triangle clicked successfully gives the player a score of +1. The game increases in difficulty every time the score reaches a multiple of 50 by increasing the spawn rate of triangles. Players start with a set amount of health, and the game ends if the player's health reaches 0.

This project is open-source and intended as a fun way to learn about game development in SFML.

## üéÆ Gameplay Features

- **Triangle Enemies**: Green triangles fall from the top of the screen.
- **Point-and-Click**: Use the mouse to click on each triangle to score points.
- **Scoring System**: Earn +1 score for each triangle clicked. The current score is displayed in the top-left corner.
- **Health System**: Start with a set amount of health; each missed triangle decreases health. When health reaches 0, the game ends.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Every 50 points, the game spawns triangles at an increased rate, making it more challenging.
